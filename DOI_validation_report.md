## Recommendations

### For Manuscript Preparation:

1. **Priority citations:** Focus on Tier 1 papers identified in mapping document
2. **Preprint updates:** Check if any 2024-2025 arXiv papers have been published in journals before final submission
3. **Dual citations:** For foundational tools (PyMC, ArviZ), cite both original paper and documentation
4. **Geographic balance:** Current selection represents global research well

### For Future Updates:

1. Monitor for journal publications of recent preprints
2. Check citation counts as 2024-2025 papers accumulate citations
3. Consider adding domain-specific reviews if journal requires
